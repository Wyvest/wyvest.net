<p>For Polyfrost: <a href="https://polyfrost.org">https://polyfrost.org</a></p>
<p>I want to talk: DM me on Discord (username is "Wyvest") or <a href="https://polyfrost.org/contact/">https://polyfrost.org/contact/</a></p>
<p>You may be wondering: why is this site so barebones? Well... firstly, I was too lazy to make a design for this. </p>
<p>But considering the polished and sometimes seemingly "corporate" design of my other products, I want this to be as raw and personal as possible.</p>
<p>No stupid JS frameworks, no CSS, no unnecessarily details. Just my thoughts.</p>
