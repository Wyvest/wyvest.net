This Privacy Policy describes how Impasta ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Information
We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) to use the App.

### B. Game Data
The App stores game data locally on your device using your device's native storage capabilities. This includes:
- Game settings (e.g., sound preferences, theme choices)
- Local game history

### C. User-Generated Content for AI Generation
If you use the "Custom Theme" feature or other dynamic content features, the text input you provide is sent to a third-party AI service (Google Gemini API) to generate game topics.
- **Google Gemini API**: We use Google's Generative AI to create game content. Data sent to this API is subject to Google's Google's Generative AI terms and Privacy Policy. We do not send personal identifiers with these requests.
